# Project Status & Next Steps (Corrected)

**Correction:** My previous assessment was incorrect. After a full review of the `backend` directory, it is clear that the backend is not only present but substantially complete and well-implemented. Please disregard the previous status file.

### 1. Backend Status: Mostly Complete & Ready for Testing

Your backend is nearly feature-complete according to the plan. All the core components are in place and appear functional.

**Key Implemented Features:**
*   **LiveKit Agent (`chat_agent.py`):** A robust agent that connects to LiveKit, handles participants joining, and processes incoming messages.
*   **Gemini Service (`gemini_service.py`):** A service that correctly connects to the Gemini API and generates responses based on a system prompt and conversation context.
*   **Mention-Based Trigger:** The agent already includes the logic to only respond when it is mentioned with "@agent", making it cost-effective.
*   **Dual-Mode Memory (`memory_service.py`):** This is the most impressive part. The service is smartly designed to:
    *   Use the `mem0` service for advanced, semantic memory if a `MEM0_API_KEY` is provided.
    *   **Gracefully fall back** to a local `memory_storage.json` file if the `mem0` key is not available. This is an excellent design for resilience and ease of setup.

### 2. How the Frontend and Backend are Integrated

That's an excellent question. The integration doesn't happen directly between the frontend and backend code (like a traditional REST API). Instead, **LiveKit itself is the integration layer.**

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.  **The Meeting Place:** Think of your LiveKit server as a digital meeting place, and each chat room (e.g., "general-chat") is a specific room within that place.
2.  **Frontend Joins:** When a user joins a room from the web interface, the frontend connects to that specific room on the LiveKit server as a participant.
3.  **Backend Joins:** When you run `python main.py`, the backend AI agent *also* connects to the LiveKit server and will join any room that a user is in.
4.  **Communication:** Now that both the user (frontend) and the agent (backend) are in the same room, they can send and receive messages. The LiveKit server handles broadcasting the messages to all participants.

The integration happens implicitly when both the frontend and the backend are configured to point to the **same LiveKit server URL** and they join the **same room name**.

### 3. Is the backend ready to use?

The backend code is fully implemented. To make it operational, you just need to run it. It is ready for you to start, test, and connect with the frontend.

**Actionable Steps to Run the Backend:**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Development\att-cap-assg\backend
    ```

2.  **Set up a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Create your environment file:** Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and populate it with your API keys. It should look like this:
    ```
    LIVEKIT_URL="wss://your-livekit-server.com"
    LIVEKIT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
    
    # Optional: If you have a mem0 key, add it here
    # MEM0_API_KEY="your-mem0-key"
    ```

6.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

After these steps, the agent will be running and will automatically join chat rooms to listen for mentions.

### 4. Memory Management Status: Implemented & Robust

Contrary to my previous report, **memory management is fully implemented.**

The `MemoryService` is designed to be flexible. It provides a solid foundation for conversation history and context.

**How to Improve It (Future Enhancements):**

The current implementation is excellent. The following are not necessary fixes but potential ideas for future enhancements:

*   **Periodic Summarization:** For very long conversations, you could add a feature where the agent uses Gemini to periodically summarize the discussion. This summary could be stored as a new, dense memory, which would keep the context provided to the LLM concise and highly relevant.
*   **Enhanced User Profiles:** The `get_user_stats` function is a great start. This could be expanded into a more comprehensive user profile that stores key facts or preferences mentioned across different conversations (e.g., "User prefers Python," "User is interested in AI").
*   **Knowledge Base Integration:** For more advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), you could connect the agent to a dedicated knowledge base (e.g., project documentation, PDFs) in addition to the conversation history. This would allow it to answer questions about specific documents, not just what was said in the chat.
